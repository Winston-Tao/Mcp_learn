# MCP HTTP Server Implementation Analysis & Solution

## Problem Analysis

Your original MCP server implementation had several issues preventing successful connection with MCP clients like Claude Desktop:

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Transport Protocol**: Using simple HTTP POST instead of HTTP+SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport
2. **Missing Connection Handshake**: No proper session management for persistent connections
3. **Blocking Operations**: Using `.block()` in reactive context causing thread blocking errors
4. **Incomplete Message Flow**: Missing the bidirectional communication pattern expected by MCP

## Solution Implemented

### 1. HTTP+SSE Transport Controller (`McpSseController.java`)

**Key Features:**
- **SSE Connection Endpoint** (`/mcp/sse`): Establishes persistent connection and returns endpoint information
- **Message Handler** (`/mcp/message`): Processes MCP requests and sends responses via SSE
- **Reactive Implementation**: Uses Spring WebFlux `Flux` and `Sinks` for non-blocking operations
- **Connection Management**: Tracks active SSE connections with unique IDs

**Connection Flow:**
1. Client connects to `/mcp/sse` to establish SSE connection
2. Server sends endpoint event containing message URL
3. Client sends MCP requests to `/mcp/message` with connection ID header
4. Server processes requests and sends responses back via SSE

### 2. Backwards Compatibility (`HttpTransportController.java`)

- Maintained simple HTTP transport at `/mcp/simple` for testing
- Allows direct request-response without SSE for debugging

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Features:

1. **Server Initialization**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:18060/mcp/simple \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}'
   ```

2. **Tool Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Calculator tool
   curl -X POST http://localhost:18060/mcp/message \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"calculator","arguments":{"operation":"add","a":10,"b":5}},"id":3}'
   # Returns: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[{"text":"10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00","type":"text"}]},"id":3}

   # Weather tool
   curl -X POST http://localhost:18060/mcp/message \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"weather","arguments":{"location":"Beijing","units":"celsius"}},"id":4}'
   ```

3. **Resource Listing**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:18060/mcp/message \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"resources/list","params":{},"id":5}'
   ```

4. **SSE Connection**:
   ```bash
   curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:18060/mcp/sse
   # Returns endpoint configuration and maintains connection
   ```

## File Structure

```
src/main/java/com/example/mcp/transport/
├── McpSseController.java      # HTTP+SSE transport (recommended)
└── HttpTransportController.java   # Simple HTTP transport (testing)
```

## Testing Files Created

1. **`test-mcp-client.html`**: Web-based client for testing HTTP+SSE functionality
2. **`claude-config-example.json`**: Example configuration for Claude Desktop (note: Claude typically expects stdio transport)

## Usage Recommendations

### For Production:
- Use the HTTP+SSE transport (`McpSseController`) for MCP client integration
- The SSE connection provides persistent bidirectional communication as expected by MCP specification

### For Development/Testing:
- Use simple HTTP transport (`HttpTransportController`) for quick testing with curl
- Use the web client (`test-mcp-client.html`) for interactive testing

### For Claude Desktop Integration:
- Most MCP implementations use stdio transport for Claude Desktop
- HTTP+SSE is more suitable for web-based applications and custom clients
- Consider implementing stdio transport wrapper for Claude Desktop compatibility

## Next Steps

If you want to integrate with Claude Desktop:
1. Implement stdio transport wrapper
2. Create executable script that communicates via stdin/stdout
3. Configure Claude Desktop to use the script

The HTTP+SSE implementation is now fully functional and follows MCP specifications for HTTP-based transport.
